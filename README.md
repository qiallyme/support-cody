# Support Cody

Welcome to the GitHub repository for [Support Cody](https://qiallyme.github.io/support-cody) — a personal donation and outreach page created by Cody Rice-Velasquez.

This site was built to:
- Provide a **central hub** for those who wish to support me during a time of urgent financial and emotional need
- Offer a simple way to donate via **GoFundMe, CashApp, Venmo, Zelle, PayPal, Square, or Apple Pay**
- Share my **resume and contact form** for those seeking reliable, hardworking help

## 🙏 Why This Page Exists

Life has brought a wave of hardships — financially, emotionally, and spiritually. I created this page not just to ask for help, but to give people a space to understand, support, and potentially offer work or opportunity.

Every share, message, and donation makes a real difference.
